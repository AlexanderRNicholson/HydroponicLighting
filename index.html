								<h2>Making the right choice</h2>
								<p>When it comes to hydroponics, you don’t want to invest hundreds of dollars into irrigation systems only to scrimp on appropriate lighting. There’s a lot to consider. Obviously the best conditions for plants are natural light, but when that isn’t possible, there are many lighting solutions available. Unfortunately current lighting options are not as efficient as sunlight and so longer periods of light are required to create similar results.</p>

								<h2>Timing is everything</h2>
								<p>On average, plants in hydroponic systems require between 14 and 16 hours of light at a time. This should be followed by a stretch of between 10 and 12 hours of darkness, to give the plants a rest period. Of course, this cycle usually works out longer than a day, and so it can be difficult to regulate effectively. Missing a cycle, or consistently over- or under-exposing your plants can have unfortunate consequences on your crops. Many hydroponic gardeners use automatic electric timers in conjunction with their lighting systems to ensure their plants are receiving the light they need, when they need it.</p>

								<h2>Watts up</h2>
								<p>Depending on the size of your hydroponic setup, a higher wattage may be required in your bulbs. This can be an issue for ambitious gardeners, but for modest setups and beginners with grow rooms under 4 square feet, less than 400w will do.</p>

								<h2>High Intensity Discharge lights</h2>
								<p>There are several broad categories of lights suitable for hydroponic growth. One of the most popular and widely used categories are <strong>High Intensity Discharge lights (HIDs)</strong>. The intensity of these types of bulb affect the height at which they can be suspended above plants. Due to their intensity they also emit a lot of heat, which can be problematic and necessitate the use of a cooling system. There are two commonly used subtypes: High Pressure Sodium bulbs, and Metal Hallide bulbs.</p>

								<h2>High Pressure Sodium</h2>
								<p>High Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs are more expensive than Metal Hallide bulbs, but have definite advantages over them. They are longer lasting, and the portion of the light spectrum they emit imitates the sun’s light during late summer and fall, which makes the bulbs perfect for plants that flower or fruit during that time.</p>

								<h2>Metal Hallide</h2>
 									<p>Metal Hallide bulbs are cheaper and have a shorter lifespan than HPS bulbs, but are more useful during growth cycles and, since they emit a portion of the light spectrum similar to what the sun emits during spring and summer, they work particularly well with leafy or vegetative plants. With fruiting and flowering plants, they are best used in a cycle with HPS bulbs, so as to make best use of their differing light palettes.</p>

								<h2>Compact Fluorescent Lighting</h2>
								<p>The second common type of hydroponic light is Compact Fluorescent Lighting (CFL), also known as T5 lights. These light strips are much cheaper than HID lights, and are more economic with electricity, not producing the large quantities of heat HID lights do. They also require replacement less frequently. T5 lighting is best used for seedlings and growth rather than flowering, as this variety of lighting does not emit the part of the spectrum fruiting and flowering plants are most sensitive to.</p>

								<h2>LED Grow Lights</h2>
								<p>The third type of hydroponic lighting solution is LED grow lights. LEDs are even more efficient and long-lived than T5 lightning, though require a larger initial investment. LED setups can be quite sophisticated, combining different variations of the light spectrum and even switching between different lighting options depending on which growth phase your plants are in. Plants grown under LEDs tend to be short but healthy, with dense growth but delayed flowering and fruiting. </p>

					<h2>High/low-light plants</h2>
					<p>Certain crops are more or less sensitive to light, and may react badly to conditions that other plants endure without issue.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Low-light plants like poinsettias, chrysanthemums, strawberries and cauliflower, along with other crops that flower in the spring, all prefer conditions with less than 12 hours exposure to light.</li>
						<li>High-light plants like wheat, lettuce, potatoes, spinach and turnips are summer-flowering plants and can happily endure up to 18 hours of light.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It’s generally best not to combine plants from these two groups in a single system, but both groups can play nicely with light-neutral crops like rice, eggplant, roses or corn, which are comfortable with any amount of light between the two extremes.</p>
