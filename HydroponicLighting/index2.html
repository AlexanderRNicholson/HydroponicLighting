								<p class="flow-text">On average, plants in hydroponic systems require between 14 and 16 hours of light at a time. This should be followed by a stretch of between 10 and 12 hours of darkness, to give the plants a rest period.

Many hydroponic gardeners use automatic electric timers in conjunction with their lighting systems to ensure their plants are receiving the light they need, when they need it.</p>

One of the most popular and widely used categories are <strong>High Intensity Discharge lights (HIDs)</strong>. The intensity of these types of bulb affect the height at which they can be suspended above plants. Due to their intensity they also emit a lot of heat, which can be problematic and necessitate the use of a cooling system. There are two commonly used subtypes: High Pressure Sodium bulbs, and Metal Hallide bulbs.</p>

With fruiting and flowering plants, they are best used in a cycle with HPS bulbs, so as to make best use of their differing light palettes.</p>
